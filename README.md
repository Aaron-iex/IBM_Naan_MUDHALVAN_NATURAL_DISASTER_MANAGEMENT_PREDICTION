Disaster Information and Risk AI
This project is a web application designed to provide information and identify potential risks related to natural disasters, leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) and custom context data.

Project Structure
The project is typically structured with a frontend (Streamlit) and a backend API (Flask or FastAPI) that interacts with an LLM and your data.

Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to get the project running locally:

1. Clone the Repository
If you haven't already, clone the project repository from GitHub:

git clone <your_repository_url>
cd <your_repository_folder>

2. Setting up a Virtual Environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

# Create a virtual environment named '.venv'
python -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

You should see (.venv) at the beginning of your terminal prompt, indicating that the virtual environment is active.

3. Install Dependencies
This project requires several Python libraries. The requirements.txt file lists these dependencies.

Before installing, open requirements.txt and uncomment the lines corresponding to:

Your chosen Backend Framework (Flask or FastAPI).

Your chosen LLM Integration method (Google Gemini API or a Local Hugging Face Model).

Any Optional dependencies you need (e.g., peft, pandas).

After editing requirements.txt, install the dependencies using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Data Setup
Place your JSONL context data files (e.g., your_context_data.jsonl, flood_risk_india.jsonl) inside the data/ directory. Ensure the data/ directory exists in the root of your project.

mkdir data # Create the data directory if it doesn't exist
# Copy your .jsonl files into the data/ directory

5. LLM Configuration
If using Google Gemini API:

Obtain an API key from the Google AI Studio or Google Cloud Console.

It is recommended to store your API key securely, for example, in a .env file in the root of your project:

GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

Ensure your backend code (backend_app.py) reads this environment variable to configure the Gemini API.

If using a Local Hugging Face Model:

Download your chosen pre-trained or fine-tuned model files.

Place the model files in a designated directory (e.g., models/).

Ensure your backend code (backend_app.py) is configured to load the model from this local path.

6. Running the Backend
The backend API needs to be running to serve requests from the frontend.

If using Flask:

python backend_app.py

If using FastAPI:

uvicorn backend_app:app --reload  # Adjust 'backend_app:app' if your file or app variable name is different

The backend should start and indicate the address and port it's listening on (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8000).

7. Running the Frontend
While the backend is running in one terminal, open a new terminal, activate your virtual environment, and start the Streamlit frontend:

streamlit run frontend_app.py

Streamlit will provide a local URL (e.g., http://localhost:8501) to view your application in your web browser.

Using the Application
Open the Streamlit application in your browser. You can enter questions related to potential disasters, weather, earthquakes, or safety procedures, optionally providing a location for context. The application will send your query to the backend, which will use the LLM and your data to generate a response.

Customization
Adding More Data: Add new JSONL files to the data/ directory and update the data loading logic in backend_app.py.

Improving LLM Responses: Refine the prompt engineering in backend_app.py or improve your fine-tuning dataset if using a local model. Implement a more sophisticated RAG system for better context retrieval.

Frontend Styling: Modify frontend_app.py. For basic styling, you can inject custom CSS using st.markdown(..., unsafe_allow_html=True). Full integration with frameworks like Tailwind CSS would require building the frontend with a different technology (e.g., React, Vue) or creating custom Streamlit components.

.gitignore
The .gitignore file is configured to exclude files that should not be committed to the repository, such as the virtual environment (.venv/), Python cache (__pycache__/, *.pyc), and the environment variables file (.env).
